# BrickBuster

## Description
Recreation of the classic arcade game BrickBuster. 

## Functionalities
Objective of the game is to break bricks and earn as many points as possible. Player will control a paddle and move it around horizontally with the mouse. A ball will spawn in the middle of the paddle, and the player can launch it by left clicking. The ball will bounce around against the walls, brick, and paddle. The player must move the paddle to block the ball from hitting the bottom of the screen, which induces a loss of life.
